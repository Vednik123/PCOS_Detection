**AI-powered PCOS Detection and Support Web App**

PCOSense Companion is a Python + Streamlit-based web application that assists in the early detection of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using ultrasound image analysis powered by a ResNet18 deep learning model. It also integrates a conversational AI assistant (Gemini 2.0) for answering user queries about PCOS symptoms, treatment, and lifestyle recommendations. This tool is intended for educational support and awareness, not medical diagnosis.
